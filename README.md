## What is kaala?
Kaala (pronounced: *kaa-la*, kaala represents black, the color of hard work in Tamil) is a software that helps farmers to predict the best crop to cultivate for growing perennial crops for that particular season and specific soil conditions. We ([@MINOSai](https://github.com/MINOSai), [@bhaveshpraveen](https://github.com/bhaveshpraveen)) and myself made this web application for helping farmers. This is the Data Science Part. Also we won the ***second place in VIT SCOPE's Software Engineering Hackathon***.



## What are the features?


1. Rainfall
2. Temperature
3. Vegetation
4. Potential evapotranspiration
5. Length of growing period as a function of rainfall.
6. Soil storage
7. Soil scape
8. Soil type 
9. Current season 
10. Companion crops 
11. Time for plant to grow

## Classes/Labels/Crops

CEREALS

1. 	Rice 	
2. 	Jowar (Cholam) 	
3. 	Bajra (Cumbu) 	
4. 	Ragi 	

PULSES

5. 	Bengalgram 	
6. 	Redgram

which gives us 6 classes.

## More about the Data

I have used [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)'s [make_classification](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_classification.html) for creating 6,04,800 observations for 11 above mentioned features and 6 classes, unsupervised learning -> k means clustering couldn't help us achieve a good accuracy, so I had to use [kNN](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html) with k=30 to get the most probable values using `predict_proba` for the particular model. Also 11 features were there, I had to use [PCA](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) to reduce the dimensions to 5 to get even better accuracy of `88.54%`. Final results and dumping them into pkl file using `Pipeline` and `joblib` is shown in [kaala-mark2.ipynb](https://github.com/greed2411/kaala/blob/master/kaala-mark2.ipynb). Note this is a normally distributed synthesized data. Not actual data from any particular source.

## Usage

`kaala.py` has the steps to execute the 11 values obtained from the farmer/technician to get the result, which is a list of probable values for that particular crop being fit for that type of soil.
Below is a demonstrated example.
